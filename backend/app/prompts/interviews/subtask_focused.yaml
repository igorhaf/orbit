  **MODE: SUBTASK FOCUSED - Atomic Subtask Generation 🔬**

  **CRITICAL OBJECTIVE:** Generate ATOMIC subtasks - each subtask = 1 executable action = 1 super fast prompt

  **WHAT IS AN ATOMIC SUBTASK:**
  ✅ **GOOD (Atomic):**
  - "Create users table in database"
  - "Add email (string) column to users table"
  - "Create POST /api/users endpoint"
  - "Add email validation to request"
  - "Create unit test for UserController::store"

  ❌ **BAD (Not atomic):**
  - "Implement user CRUD" (too broad, needs decomposition)
  - "Do authentication and authorization" (2 actions, should be 2 subtasks)
  - "Create database and endpoints" (2 actions, should be 2 subtasks)

  **CRITICAL RULES:**
  1. **1 Subtask = 1 Action = 1 Executable Prompt**
     - If you think "and also needs...", STOP! That's another subtask!
     - Each subtask should be executable in minutes, not hours

  2. **AI Decides How Many Questions (No Fixed Limit)**
     - Use common sense: 3-10 questions is usually enough
     - Stop when you have enough context to generate atomic subtasks
     - If user answers completely, fewer questions are needed

  3. **Focus on Maximum Decomposition**
     - Ask about SPECIFIC PARTS of the task
     - Identify dependencies between subtasks
     - Break complexity into simple actions

  4. **Atomicity Criteria:**
     - ✅ Can be described in 1 short sentence (< 10 words)?
     - ✅ Executes in < 30 minutes?
     - ✅ Has 1 file/component as main focus?
     - ✅ Doesn't use "and" or "also" in description?
     - If NO to any, decompose more!

  **QUESTION FORMAT:**
  ❓ Pergunta {{ question_num }}: [Your question focused on ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION in Portuguese]

  For SINGLE CHOICE:
  ○ Option 1
  ○ Option 2
  ○ Option 3

  For MULTIPLE CHOICE:
  ☐ Option 1
  ☐ Option 2
  ☐ Option 3
  ☑️ [Select all that apply]

  **FOCUS AREAS (use as guide, don't ask everything):**
  1. **Specific Scope**: What EXACT part of the task? (database/API/UI/logic/validation)
  2. **Granularity**: More detail? (e.g.: "create endpoint" → separate GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
  3. **Dependencies**: What must be done BEFORE? (e.g.: migration before model)
  4. **Sequence**: What order makes sense? (database → backend → frontend)
  5. **Edge Cases**: Validations? Errors? Special cases? (each one = 1 subtask)
  6. **Tests**: Unit/integration tests? (each type = 1 subtask)

  **ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION EXAMPLE:**

  Parent Task: "Implement user registration"

  Generated Atomic Subtasks (8 subtasks):
  1. Create users table migration (id, name, email, password, timestamps)
  2. Create User model with fillable and hidden fields
  3. Create UserRequest with email and password validation
  4. Create POST /api/users endpoint in routes/api.php
  5. Implement UserController::store with password hash
  6. Create unit test for duplicate email validation
  7. Create integration test for POST /api/users
  8. Add success message on frontend after registration

  **Your mission:** Ask smart questions to generate subtasks with this level of atomicity!
